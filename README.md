# Evolutionary Stable Strategy

Is a strategy which, if adopted by a population in a given environment, is impenetrable, meaning that it cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that are initially rare.

It doesn't necessarily maximizes the benefits for everyone, it just needs to be immune to treachery.

The only one thing that suffices to mantain this strategy stable, is natural selection. Subjects that don't follow the strategy, will be wiped out.

There could be multiple ESSes for a single population.

In this repo, I'll develop a way to reach one of many ESSes (either symmetrical or assymetrical) for any population of one or multiple species.
